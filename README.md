# <p align='center'>Mugging Callout</p>
## Description
The <strong>Mugging Callout</strong> spawns a victim and a mugger in a random place chosen from a list of possible locatins. Once the player arrives on scene the victim will run toward the player and ask for help using in game dialogue. The mugger will attempt to harm the victim and chase after them. The player must stop the mugger or the victim could be killed.

## Installation
#### Option 1: Build it yourself
Download the project from Releases, open it in Visual Studio. Build the project to create the Mugging.net.dll file, which should be in the 'bin\Debug' folder in the project solution. Place that file in your callout folder at 'fivepd\callouts\' .
#### Option 2: Download the callout at GPM

## Updates
I plan to keep this callout updated as new versions of FivePD are released.
